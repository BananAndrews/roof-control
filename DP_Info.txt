How are Tuya Devices controllable via Wi-Fi module TY-WFH - Slide Garage Door openers are being controlled - what commands do they accept to open and close the door? particularly DP ID or anything else

Tuya-enabled Slide Garage Door openers controlled via the TY-WFH Wi-Fi module operate using data points (DPs) that represent device functions like opening and closing the door. The core commands use specific DP IDs:

- DP 1: Action trigger for opening/closing the door. Setting DP 1 to true sends the command to open, while false sends the command to close the door[1][2].
- DP 101: Status report on whether the door is open (true) or closed (false). This provides feedback so automations or UI can reflect the real state[1][2].
- Additional DPs: Some devices may have others for stop, lock, countdown, or advanced status (e.g. DP 7 always 0 in certain models)[1][2][3].

These DPs are accessed over serial (MCU integration) or through Tuya's cloud/app API, and commands for open/close are sent and received in the form of JSON, e.g. {"1":true} to open and {"1":false} to close[2][3].

### Relevant DP Commands

- Open Door: Send command { "1": true } to DP 1[2][3].
- Close Door: Send command { "1": false } to DP 1[2][3].
- Status/Feedback: Read DP 101 (if true, the door is open; if false, closed)[1][2].
- Some implementations also use additional DP IDs for more features, such as DP 102 for the timer and DP 103 for advanced state[2].

### Example Device DP Schema

| DP ID | Function        | Action/Value      |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1     | Open/Close     | true/false [1][2][3] |
| 7     | Constant?      | Always 0 [1]             |
| 101   | Door Status    | true (open) / false (closed) [1][2] |
| 102   | Timer (secs)   | Door open/close duration [2]        |
| 103   | Advanced state | Context-specific [2]        |

### Control Methods

- Via Tuya app/cloud API by sending the relevant DP command[4][3].
- Over serial interface using Tuya’s MCU protocol where the module relays DP commands[5][6][7].
- Integration with automation platforms (Home Assistant, Homebridge, etc.) is accomplished by mapping these DPs as switches or binary sensors[1][2][3].

DP 1 is the principal method for triggering open/close on the door, while DP 101 reports back the actual door status—these are the key commands to operate Tuya Wi-Fi garage door openers using the TY-WFH module[1][2][3].
