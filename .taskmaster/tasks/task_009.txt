# Task ID: 9
# Title: Apply Minimalist CSS Styling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a simple stylesheet to provide a clean, functional, and user-friendly layout for the web interface, focusing on usability.
# Details:
Create a `style.css` file and link it in `index.html`. Use CSS to center the content on the page. Style the buttons to be easily clickable with clear labels. Style the status display to be prominent and readable. Use a simple color scheme and font.

# Test Strategy:
Load the webpage and visually inspect the UI. Confirm that the layout is clean, buttons are distinct, and the text is legible. Check for responsiveness on a standard desktop browser window size.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create and Link Minimalist Stylesheet [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new 'style.css' file with minimal, clean CSS. Link this stylesheet in the 'index.html' file to ensure styles are applied to the web interface.
### Details:
Ensure the stylesheet uses semantic selectors and avoids unnecessary classes or IDs. Confirm the link tag is correctly placed in the HTML head.

## 2. Apply Minimalist CSS for Layout, Buttons, and Status Display [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Write CSS rules to center the main content, style buttons for usability (large clickable area, clear labels), and make the status display prominent and readable. Use a simple color scheme and legible font.
### Details:
Follow minimalist CSS best practices: use as few fonts and colors as possible, keep selectors simple, and ensure high contrast for readability. Style the layout using margin or flexbox for centering, and use padding and font-weight for button and status display emphasis.

## 3. Test and Refine Appearance and Responsiveness [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Open the web interface in a browser to verify that the layout is centered, buttons are distinct and usable, and the status display is clear. Adjust CSS as needed for clean appearance and basic responsiveness.
### Details:
Visually inspect the UI on a standard desktop browser. Check that all elements are styled as intended and that the interface remains usable when resizing the window. Make minor CSS adjustments if necessary.
