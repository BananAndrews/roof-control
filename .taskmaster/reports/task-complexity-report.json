		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Node.js Project and Setup Express Server",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the initialization and setup into: (1) Install Node.js and verify installation, (2) Initialize npm project and create package.json, (3) Install Express and add to dependencies, (4) Create project folder structure including 'public', (5) Implement and test a basic Express server that serves static files and listens on a configurable port.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard foundational task for any Node.js web application. It is straightforward but should be broken down to ensure best practices in project structure, dependency management, and server configuration are followed for maintainability and scalability[1][2]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Configuration Management for Tuya API Credentials",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Install and configure dotenv, (2) Create and document .env file with required variables, (3) Add .env to .gitignore, (4) Implement configuration module to load and export environment variables, (5) Validate and test environment variable loading at server startup.",
			"reasoning": "Secure configuration management is essential for any production-grade Node.js app. Using dotenv and .env files is industry standard, but ensuring variables are loaded, validated, and not committed to version control requires explicit steps[2][4]."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Tuya API Authentication and Connection Service",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Research and select Tuya API client library, (2) Install and configure the library, (3) Implement service module for authentication and token management, (4) Integrate configuration module for credentials, (5) Expose device interaction methods, (6) Write and run authentication test script.",
			"reasoning": "Connecting to a third-party API with authentication and token management introduces moderate complexity, especially with external dependencies and the need for robust error handling and abstraction for future extensibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Backend Endpoint to Get Gate Status",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Define GET /api/status route in Express, (2) Integrate with tuyaService to fetch device status, (3) Parse and format response as JSON, (4) Implement and document endpoint test using Postman or curl.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a REST endpoint that interacts with an external service is a common backend task. Complexity is moderate due to the need for correct data parsing and error handling, but the logic is straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create Backend Endpoints for Gate Control (Open, Close, Stop)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Define POST endpoints for open, close, and stop, (2) Implement command dispatch logic in tuyaService, (3) Identify and document correct DP IDs and values, (4) Handle and log errors, (5) Test each endpoint with Postman/curl and physical device.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing multiple control endpoints requires careful mapping of commands to device actions and robust error handling, especially when integrating with hardware APIs. Testing with the physical device adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Basic Frontend HTML Structure",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Create index.html in public directory, (2) Add button elements with appropriate IDs, (3) Add status display element, (4) Link CSS and JavaScript files.",
			"reasoning": "Basic HTML scaffolding is a low-complexity task, but should be explicit to ensure all required elements and links are present for later integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Frontend JavaScript for Button Controls",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Create app.js and link to HTML, (2) Add event listeners to buttons, (3) Implement fetch POST requests to backend endpoints, (4) Handle and log responses, (5) Test button interactions and network requests in browser dev tools.",
			"reasoning": "Client-side event handling and API integration are standard, but require attention to asynchronous logic, error handling, and user feedback for reliability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Frontend Status Polling and Display",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Implement polling logic with setInterval, (2) Fetch status from backend endpoint, (3) Update status display element, (4) Test real-time updates with manual gate operation.",
			"reasoning": "Periodic polling and DOM updates are common in web apps, but require careful timing and error handling to avoid UI glitches or excessive network usage."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Apply Minimalist CSS Styling",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Create and link style.css, (2) Style layout, buttons, and status display for usability, (3) Test appearance and responsiveness in browser.",
			"reasoning": "Minimal CSS for layout and usability is a low-complexity task, but should be explicit to ensure clarity and accessibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Create User Documentation (README.md)",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Draft prerequisites and setup instructions, (2) Document Tuya credential acquisition, (3) Write installation and configuration steps, (4) Add usage instructions for running and using the app, (5) Review and test documentation with a non-developer.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive documentation is essential for usability and onboarding, but the task is straightforward if broken into logical sections and validated by user testing."
