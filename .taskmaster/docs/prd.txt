# Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a web-based interface to control a Tuya-compatible Automatic Slide Gate Opener (model NI600Z) from a PC. The goal is to provide a simple, local web application that replicates the core functionality of mobile apps like Tuya Smart, enabling users to open, close, and stop the gate directly from their computer's web browser.

# Core Features
The initial version (MVP) of the application will focus on the following essential features:
- **Open Gate:** A button that sends a command to fully open the gate.
- **Close Gate:** A button that sends a command to fully close the gate.
- **Stop Gate:** A button that sends a command to immediately halt the gate's movement.
- **Display Status:** A simple text indicator to show the current status of the gate (e.g., "Open", "Closed", "Opening", "Closing", "Stopped").

# User Experience
- **User Persona:** The primary user is the owner of the gate opener who wants a convenient way to control it from their PC without using a mobile device.
- **User Flow:** The user navigates to a local URL in their web browser. The interface will present clear buttons for "Open," "Close," and "Stop." The user clicks the desired action button, and the gate responds accordingly. The status text updates to reflect the gate's current state.
- **UI/UX Considerations:** The interface will be minimalist and functional, prioritizing ease of use over complex design. It will consist of three main control buttons and a status display.

# Technical Architecture
- **System Components:**
    1.  A lightweight backend server (e.g., using Node.js with Express or Python with Flask) to handle API calls to the Tuya cloud.
    2.  A simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend to provide the user interface.
- **APIs and Integrations:** The application will integrate with the **Tuya IoT Platform API**. This requires the user to:
    1.  Create a Tuya developer account.
    2.  Set up a "Cloud Project" within the Tuya IoT Platform.
    3.  Link their gate opener device to the project.
    4.  Obtain API credentials (Access ID, Access Key, etc.) to be used in the application's configuration.
- **Infrastructure Requirements:** The application will be designed to run locally on the user's PC. No external hosting is required.

# Development Roadmap
- **MVP Requirements:**
    1.  Establish a secure connection to the Tuya IoT Platform API using the provided credentials.
    2.  Implement backend functions to send `open`, `close`, and `stop` commands to the device.
    3.  Implement a backend function to poll for and retrieve the device's current status.
    4.  Create a minimalist web interface with three buttons (Open, Close, Stop) and a text area for status.
    5.  Link the frontend buttons to the backend functions.
    6.  Display the retrieved status on the web page.

- **Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for MVP):**
    -   Visual representation of the gate's status.
    -   User authentication or multi-user support.
    -   Scheduling or timer-based actions.
    -   Direct local network control (if feasible) to reduce cloud dependency.

# Logical Dependency Chain
1.  **Tuya API Credentials:** The absolute first step is for the user to set up their Tuya developer account and obtain the necessary API keys. The application cannot function without these.
2.  **Backend API Logic:** Develop the core logic to authenticate with and send commands to the Tuya API. This is the foundational layer.
3.  **Frontend Interface:** Once the backend can control the device, build the simple web UI to trigger the backend functions.

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk:** The Tuya API may be complex or have unclear documentation.
  - **Mitigation:** Allocate time for thoroughly reading the official Tuya IoT Platform documentation. Start with simple API calls (like getting device status) to ensure the connection is working before implementing control commands.
- **Risk:** Device-specific commands may differ from the general Tuya standard.
  - **Mitigation:** Use the "API Explorer" and "Device Log" features in the Tuya IoT Platform to debug and identify the exact commands and status values being sent and received by the specific gate opener model.
